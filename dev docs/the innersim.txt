
CONSIDER: Named Slots.
	OBS: Handle-to-plan slot matching could work with names just the same as it does with numbers.
		When a charge is passed across plan/handle divide, the system currently looks for an exact match (slot 5 sends a signal to slot 5) on an int variable. This could just as easily be a string instead.
	OBS: An auto-name system like when saving plans could be used.
		When a new slot is created (by adding a wire) it is currently assigned the first available int. This could be made to be the first available capital letter instead (A,B,C,AB,AC,etc). This would provide an easy default value and also allow for a single, simple mechanic (just matching on exact string equality). Note that unlike with plan naming, "auto names" should not be denoted by a special symbol and are effectively not differentiated from real names.
	OBS: A plan/handle complex will draw a single interface "array" of slots. The slots in this array will be the union of the slots on the handle and the plan (sorted alphabetically).
	OBS: Interface: There must be a novel string input control. Controls to cycle up/down the slots are optional (if provided, the "end" could be the first available capital letter).
	OBS: Drawing: I guess having a fairly low maximum character limit is necessary to not take up too much space. Unless I use tooltips or something (nah).

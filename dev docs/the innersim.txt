PLAN LOADING:
	containment traversal ordering algo:
		Read from the XML and create a map<planIDs, vector<directly contained planIDs> >
		From that create another map of map<planIDs, vector<directly or indirectly contained planIDs> >
		From that create another map of map<planIDs, vector<directly or indirectly containing planIDs> >
		Iterate through the map (in any order) and assign a float order value (FOV) that is bigger than biggest containing planIDs FOV and smaller than the smallest contained planIDs FOV.
		Sort by FOV.
	Traversal categories:
		Named (by name, by id)
		All (by id)
		Ancestry(as is?)
		Containment(5 keys: parents, children, next/prev siblings, accept)

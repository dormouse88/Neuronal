TERMINOLOGY:
	INNERSIM		- The contents of a BRAIN
	PLAN			- A board of DEVICEs and WIREs that essentially forms a visual function. (May hold other PLANs within itself via HANDLEs).
	PLANOWNED		- DEVICEs and WIREs collectively.
	DEVICE			- A component of a PLAN that has a location.
	WIRE			- A CHARGE-carrying connection between two DEVICEs, or between a DEVICE and its parent PLAN.
	HANDLE			- A DEVICE that has a space to hold a PLAN
	NEURON			- A DEVICE that acts as the sole logic primitive.
	BULB			- An optional feature of a NEURON that delays the output.
	TAG				- The property that determines CHARGE transmission between a HANDLE and its contained PLAN.
	PORT			- Pseudo-elements of a PLAN that form the interface with containing HANDLE. PORTs correlate to TAGs and can be wired similarly to default NEURONs.
	CHARGE			- The two-state "data" that DEVICEs and WIREs carry.
	(CHIP			- (no longer used)(redundant term)
	(JUMPER			- (no longer used)(to-be-redundant component)
	(SOCKET			- (no longer used)(confused and now-superceded term)
	(SLOT			- (no longer used)(superceded by TAG)

	OUTERGAME		- An ARENA and its contents
	ARENA			- The playing field for ENTITYs
	SPAWNER			- A cursor located on the ARENA that can create an ENTITY
	ENTITY			- An actor on the ARENA (inc GOALs?) (not inc SPAWNERS?)
	CAT				- An ENTITY that kills MOUSEs
	MOUSE			- An ENTITY that the player controls the BRAIN of
	GOAL			- The target which the MOUSE has to reach to win.
	PUPPET			- An ENTITY controlled by a BRAIN
	BRAIN			- An interface between a PLAN and a PUPPET
	XPUTS			- Elements of a BRAIN that represent abilities of a PUPPET.
	SPECIFIED		- In a state of having the set of possible configurations collapsed down to a single configuration
	DESPECIFIED		- In a state of having only the set of possible configurations.
	TIMERANGE		- Time DESPECIFIED
	TIMEEXACT		- Time SPECIFIED
	
	LEVEL			- A defined configuration of an ARENA and its contents.

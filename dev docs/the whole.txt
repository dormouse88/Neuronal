TERMINOLOGY:
	INNERSIM		- The contents of a BRAIN
	PLAN			- A board of DEVICEs and WIREs that essentially forms a visual function. (May hold other PLANs within itself via HANDLEs).
	PLANOWNED		- DEVICEs and WIREs collectively.
	DEVICE			- A component of a PLAN that has a location.
	WIRE			- A CHARGE-carrying connection between two DEVICEs, or between a DEVICE and its parent PLAN.
	HANDLE			- A DEVICE that has a space to hold a PLAN
	NEURON			- A DEVICE that acts as the sole logic primitive.
	BULB			- An optional feature of a NEURON that delays the output.
	SLOT/TAG		- The property that determines CHARGE transmission between a HANDLE and its contained PLAN.
	?PORT?			- Pseudo-elements of a HANDLE that correlate to SLOTs and can be wired similarly to default NEURONs.
	CHARGE			- The two-state "data" that DEVICEs and WIREs carry.

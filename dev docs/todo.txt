Multichannel wires
named slots


General
=======
	Why CPU load + Framerate loss when exploded?
Visual / Interface
==================
	Draw slot matching + valency (to show how many slots are ignored in both directions) between handles and chips.
	Set discrete zoom levels + use a smarter better centering algo (like googlemaps).
	Solve: No space to see wires between exploded chips when adjacent. Disallow adjacency? Draw plan boundary half a cell inwards? (changing GRID_SIZE doesn't help exploded chips)
	Make wire text labels circle-shaped and place them intelligently (on wire but close to device).
	Allow chip cycling while unexploded and draw name on the handle.
	Choose highest number plan to load into an empty plan, not lowest.
	Plan Grabbers are unnecessary if using dedicated keys for collapse and expand. EDIT: Still used for plan selection for wiring. 2ndEDIT: Until Ports
	View centers in wrong place in both: 1 Plan collapse and 2 Plan Load/Wipe
	Add a reset all charge button.
	Add a collapse all/expand! all button.
	Add a device copy button? (useful for non-empty handles)
	Add an encapsulate button. This will put all devices (and their wires) within a rectangular area bounded by the cursors into a newly created sub-plan. Fucking groovy. May require multiwires.
	Make sure autoname symbol (@) doesn't get sorted between numbers and letters.
	Allow spaces or underscores in names.
	Add flashing insert cursor when entering text.

InnerSim
========
	Add in Plan Loading:
		db trimming,
		note attachments,
		read-only loading,
		containment tree traversal.

	CONSIDER: Multichannel wires?
	CONSIDER: Named slots?

Inbetween
=========
	Split view for arena/brain
	Tools to make cat plans (plan exporting) (related to db trimming)
	Allow viewing of cat brains. (if only for debugging and level design)
	More robust XML loading (with feedback on failures)


OuterGame
=========
	Add goals
	Freezing cats

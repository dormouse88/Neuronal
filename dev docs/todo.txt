Not Commited
============


General
=======
	Finalize some good names for terms
	Why CPU load + Framerate loss when exploded?
Visual / Interface
==================
	Draw neurons as two halves with independent firing states. Change the neuron shape?
	Draw slot matching + valency (to show how many slots are ignored in both directions) between handles and chips.
	Set discrete zoom levels?
	Solve: No space to see wires between exploded chips when adjacent. Disallow adjacency? Draw plan boundary half a cell inwards? (changing GRID_SIZE doesn't help exploded chips)
	Place circular wire labels intelligently (on wire but close to device).
	Allow chip cycling while unexploded and draw name on the handle.
	Choose highest number plan to load into an empty plan, not lowest.
	Change explode key from AZ to something else. AZ is a modifying key.
	Fix that device movement 'animation feature' so it doesn't trigger on plan loads.
	View centers in wrong place in both: 1 Plan collapse and 2 Plan Load/Wipe
	Add a reset all charge button.
	Add a collapse all/expand! all button.
	Add a device copy button?
	Add an encapsulate button. This will put all devices (and their wires) within a rectangular area bounded by the cursors into a newly created sub-plan. Fucking groovy. May require multiwires.
	Make sure autoname symbol (@) doesn't get sorted between numbers and letters.
	Allow spaces or underscores in names.
	Add flashing insert cursor when entering text.

InnerSim
========
	Add in Plan Loading:
		db trimming,
		note attachments,
		read-only loading,
		containment tree traversal.
	CONSIDER: Neurons subsuming jumper functionality.
	CONSIDER: Multichannel wires?
	CONSIDER: Named slots?
		handle-to-plan slot matching could work with names just the same as it does with numbers (though refactoring would then be tricky). An auto-name system like when saving plans could be used.

OuterGame
=========
	CONSIDER: How to define a test suite? (Simple vs uncheapability payoffs)
	CONSIDER: Use a 'Wait' output or 'Send' output?
	CONSIDER: Repeating inputs or once only? Repeating!!!

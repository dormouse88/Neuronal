Ultimately, think about if any proposed system is better than conventional saving.

? Allow user to "delete" plans, except they are only 'safely deleted', as in removed from the load selection options (library).
? Rather than the usual language of 'saving and deleting', think in terms of 'promoting and relegating' from/to the library.
? Use Starred Plans / Star rankings
? When cycling through plans, have a control to toggle between all-plans or starred-only or named-only.

Saving by name:
	? Names are stored in their own container of which they are a primaryish key OR as an optional detail in container of planIDs.
	? Textual input for saving and searching
	
Either:
	Allow storage of notes attached to plans.
	History navigation controls to allow selecting ancestor, descendents and siblings.
	Database trimming may be necessary for space and declutter reasons.
	Allow plans to be loaded in read-only mode
	
Could use letters AB, AC, etc as a different way of presenting numbers.

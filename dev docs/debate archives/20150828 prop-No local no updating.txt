No local Versions:
	Plans don't save cached versions of their subplans. Links only.
No Auto-updating:
	Once a plan is saved, it won't and can't be changed directly or indirectly through a subplan change.
	If the user was to "update" a subplan B within plan A, that would be to link A's handle to a different serial (presumably a version-child of B), and "A" would be saved as a new serial. The original A would be unaffected.
All Plans saved forever:
	Saving saves ALL open plans independently in the master db. Plans can never be deleted.
Plans have serial numbers:
	Each plan is assigned the first unused serial number upon save.
	Each plan also stores its version-parent plan number (except originals). This allows for a user-traversible tree of plans.
	User can move left (up to the single parent), up or down (amongst the many siblings) or right (to the (first of) many children)

Names are superficial and can come later. Use paper for now.

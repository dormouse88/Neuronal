
ENTITIES AND LEVELS:
	How to make certain level configurations?
		Randomly placed holes in walls?
			Wall has a plan that detects once on first tick and moves forward (until OOB) upon detection. A perpendicular moving cat with greater (random) headstart is the detected entity. It also moves OOB.
		Scents??
			Perhaps can't be placed directly by level designer? Must be marked by a cat with appropriate plan.
			
	Interaction rules:
		Timing:
			An oncoming MOUSE and DANGER-ACTIVE would pass thru each other if even number of spaces between them!
			Change Logic sequence so DANGER and MICE have alternate turns rather than simultaneous? Then test Interactions after either turn.
		Killing:
			OOB kills anything.
			DANGER kills MOUSE.
		Detection:
			Whiskers detect all adjacent DANGER blocks.
			Ears detect movement within certain radius.
		Termination:
			Mouse Dies (Lose)
			Mouse Touches Goal (Win)
		CATS meet GOAL:
			Cats could optionally sit on goals (using goal detection or level design tricks) as a mechanism for fucking them up. This makes CAT-GOAL collisions level-determined and don't have to be a fundamental mechanic.
		
	Maybe a big distinction between different PLANs? Not such a strong distinction between STATICs and CATs?
		ENTITY	DANGER	DUMB		 		No plan , Spawns at collapsed value. 
		ENTITY	DANGER	FREEZING 			Has plan, Spawns at collapsed value. Freezes in place at t = 0!
		ENTITY	DANGER	ACTIVE	 			Has plan, Spawns at collapsed value.
		ENTITY	MOUSE 						Has plan, Spawns at zero.
		OBS: DUMB is just a cosmetic type of DANGER when there is no plan assigned.
